### Avenues for coming up with an IDEA
    * What problems do you have in your everyday life that you would like to solve?
    * What are you passionate about?
    
### Step 2: Working on the Overveiw
    * Brainstorm about what kind of features you would like to have, write them down as you think of it, examples:

    A user can fill out a form where you can create a recipe with instructions on how to create and ingredients added to the recipe. A user can list out the recipes and select the recipe they may want to like or comment on. A user can delete their own recipes and edit their own recipes as well. A search bar to search through the list of recipes

### Step 3: List out all the features
    * Form to create Recipes (submit, post)
    * List out recipes (DomContentLoaded, get)
    * a user can like a recipe (click, patch)
    * a user can comment on a recipe(submit, post)
    * a user can delete their recipe (click, delete)
    * a user can edit their recipe (submit, patch)
    * a user can search their recipese (submit)

### Step 4: come up with an MVP(what is needed)
    * form to create Recipe (submit)
    * List out recipes (DomContentLoaded)
    * a user can delete their recipe (click)
    
### Step 5: listing out your strech goals(what can be added later)
    * a user can edit their recipe (submit)
    * a user can search their recipese (submit)
    * a user can like a recipe (click)
    * a user can comment on a recipe(submit)
